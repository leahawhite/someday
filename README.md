# Someday

The Someday app is a note-keeping app that serves to both remind and inspire you to participate in all of the cultural happenings that you've been meaning to get to. 

## Motivation

Whenever I talk with friends, we inevitably discuss recommendations based on where we've been or what we've been reading/watching/listening to, but I never write them down because it's just not convenient mid-conversation. The Someday app is a place to store all of those suggestions so that you can revisit them when you have a spare moment.     

## How It Works

From the landing page, users must either log in with the demo to explore or sign up to make an account. After login, users will be taken to their dashboard, where they can explore existing notes by category (Watch, Read, Listen, Eat, Do, Go, Archives) or make a new note. When they select a particular note, users can choose to edit, delete, or archive it.
